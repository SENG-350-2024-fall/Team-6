1. Patient
2. Doctor
3. Nurse
4. Admin
5. Program/Application Maintainer

(Add descriptions and reasoning behind identified actors)

**Meeting 2 - Sep 19**

After reviewing the project Milestone 1 guidelines and gathering more information about the project, we discussed further
as a team in the lab. We decided to change our primary actors to include a doctor, nurse, ED staff, patient, and system administrator.
To avoid clutter, we planned to create a separate use case diagram for each primary actor, as having one diagram for all would be
too complex. We divided the work evenly among our five team members, with each member taking responsibility for one actor. Each
member will create a use case diagram for their assigned actor and also write a minimum of five textual use cases.
We aim to complete the diagrams by the following Monday after our meeting, and weâ€™ll schedule another time to meet before
the next lab to finalize Milestone 1.
