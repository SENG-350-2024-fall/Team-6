2. Doctor
3. Nurse
4. Admin

(Add descriptions and reasoning behind identified actors)

**Meeting 2 - Sep 19**

After reviewing the guidelines for Milestone 1 and gathering additional information about the project,
our team engaged in further discussions during our lab session. We have decided to update our primary actors
to include a doctor, nurse, ED staff, patient, and system administrator.
<br>
To maintain clarity and organization, we will create a separate use case diagram for each primary actor,
as combining all actors into a single diagram would be overly complex. We have evenly distributed the workload
among our five team members, with each member responsible for developing the use case diagram and writing a
minimum of five textual use cases for their assigned actor.
<br>
Our goal is to complete these diagrams by the following Monday after our meeting. Additionally, we plan
to schedule another meeting before the next lab to finalize Milestone 1.
