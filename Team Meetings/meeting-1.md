**Meeting 1 - Sep 12**

During the first week of lab, we formed our groups and began by reviewing the Milestone 1 description both individually and as a team. We decided to work on the same project specified in the milestone rather than selecting our own topics.
<br><br>
Each of us began collaborating on the overall use case diagram, aiming to consider all possible actors while determining which would be the primary ones. We divided the research tasks among ourselves, with each member focusing on one actor to generate ideas for our next lab session.
<br><br>
Most of our time was spent on group formation and thoroughly understanding the requirements for Milestone 1. Below are some primary actors we thought would be good to start with.
<br><br>
Actors of application Identified to be:
1. Patient
2. Doctor
3. Nurse
4. Admin
5. Program/Application Maintainer

**Meeting 2 - Sep 19**

After reviewing the guidelines for Milestone 1 and gathering additional information about the project,
our team engaged in further discussions during our lab session. We have decided to update our primary actors
to include a doctor, nurse, ED staff, patient, and system administrator.
<br><br>
To maintain clarity and organization, we will create a separate use case diagram for each primary actor,
as combining all actors into a single diagram would be overly complex. We have evenly distributed the workload
among our five team members, with each member responsible for developing the use case diagram and writing a
minimum of five textual use cases for their assigned actor.
<br><br>
Our goal is to complete these diagrams by the following Monday after our meeting. Additionally, we plan
to schedule another meeting before the next lab to finalize Milestone 1.

**Meeting 3 - Sep 26**

Our team met to refine our Milestone 1 project. Since the work was divided efficiently,
each member presented their progress, and we reviewed one another's work, offering suggestions
for improvements as a team. We also discussed additional use cases and incorporated them into the project.


**Meeting 4 - Oct 03**

We started working on Milestone 2 and discussed how we want to proceed with the project. After reviewing the requirements, we identified the diagrams we need to create for this phase. To help track our progress, we added an incremental construction section where we will log the work as it develops.

During the meeting, we focused on the class diagram. All team members collaborated, and we were able to create a rough draft of the class diagram together. This will serve as the foundation for refining the rest of the diagrams as we move forward.

**Meeting 5 - Oct 10**

In today’s meeting, we finalized the class diagram and are satisfied with its current state. From here, we planned how to proceed by dividing the remaining diagrams among team members, with each person responsible for about 4-5 diagrams. This ensures that the workload is distributed evenly across the team.

We briefly discussed the diagrams to clarify any questions, and we aim to have them completed by Sunday or Monday. After that, we’ve scheduled another meeting to review the diagrams and start planning the coding phase, which we will begin working on afterward.
