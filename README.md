# Mister Ed: Medical Information System for Emergency Departments

**Mister Ed** is a medical information system designed to alleviate the overcrowding and overloading of Emergency Departments (EDs). The system provides patients with real-time information about the current load of EDs in their area and offers a virtual registration and triage process to help manage ED resources more efficiently.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time ED Load Information**: Patients can view the current load of nearby EDs to make informed decisions on where to seek care.
- **Virtual Registration and Triage**: Patients can register virtually for an ED visit and undergo a "virtual triage" to determine whether they need emergency care or if another course of action is more appropriate (e.g., visiting a GP, taking medication, or contacting a clinician hotline).
- **Home-Based Waiting**: Patients who are safely triaged virtually but still need to visit the ED can wait at home and will be notified when itâ€™s their turn to come in.
- **In-Person Triage**: Patients who need in-person triage can attend the ED and then return home until it's time for their appointment.

### Benefits:
- Reduces unnecessary ED visits by guiding patients toward alternative care options when appropriate.
- Manages ED resources by prioritizing patients based on the urgency of their condition.
- Enhances the patient experience by allowing them to wait at home instead of crowded ED waiting rooms.

### Project Vision:
Mister Ed is designed to help streamline emergency care, ensuring that patients receive timely and appropriate treatment while reducing the strain on busy emergency departments.
